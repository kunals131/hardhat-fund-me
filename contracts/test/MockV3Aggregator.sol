   /**
    * Mocking is primarily used in unit testing.
    * An oobject under test may have dependencies ppm 
    * other complexx objects. To isolate the behaviour of object
    * you want to replace the other objects by mocks that simulate the 
    * behaviour of the real objects. This is useful if the real objects are imparactical
    * to incorporate into the unit tests.
    * 
    * In short mocking is creating objects that simulate the behaviour of real objects.
